# Docker Build Strategy Analysis

## Current Issue
- Multi-platform build taking 15+ minutes and timing out
- Large PyTorch dependencies (800MB+) downloading slowly
- Building AMD64 + ARM64 simultaneously is resource intensive

## Recommended Solutions

### üöÄ Option 1: Quick Single Platform Build (2-3 minutes)
```bash
docker build -f deployment/Dockerfile.quick -t esengendo730/sanfrancisco_business_model:quick .
docker push esengendo730/sanfrancisco_business_model:quick
```
**Pros**: Fast, uses PyTorch base image, tests functionality quickly
**Cons**: Single platform only, larger final image size

### ‚≠ê Option 2: GitHub Actions CI/CD (Recommended)
- Let the automated pipeline handle the build (better resources)
- Already configured for multi-platform builds
- Runs automatically on push to main
- More reliable network/bandwidth

### üîß Option 3: Optimized Multi-Platform (Current approach)
```bash
# Build AMD64 first, then ARM64 separately
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f deployment/Dockerfile.multi-platform -t esengendo730/sanfrancisco_business_model:amd64 --push .
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -f deployment/Dockerfile.multi-platform -t esengendo730/sanfrancisco_business_model:arm64 --push .
```

## Recommendation
**Use Option 2 (GitHub Actions)** - it's already set up and will build automatically with better resources.
The current CI/CD pipeline will build and deploy optimized multi-platform images without local resource constraints.
