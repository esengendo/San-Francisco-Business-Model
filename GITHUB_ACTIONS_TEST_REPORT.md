# GitHub Actions & Docker Hub Test Report

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Updated 2025-07-20 22:15 UTC

### 🐛 Root Cause Identified & Fixed:
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions was using main `Dockerfile` which referenced `app/app.py`
- **Solution**: Updated main `Dockerfile` CMD to use `app/main.py` entry point
- **Status**: Fix committed and pushed (commit: e3a813e)

### Current Status:
- ✅ **GitHub Secrets**: Properly configured (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME & DOCKERHUB_TOKEN)
- ✅ **Docker Hub**: Repository accessible with previous images
- 🔄 **New Workflow**: Triggered by Dockerfile fix at 2025-07-20T22:15 UTC
- 🚀 **Expected Result**: Successful multi-platform deployment

### Latest Test Results - 2025-07-20 22:00 UTC:

#### ✅ Docker Hub Connectivity Test:
```bash
docker pull esengendo730/sf-business-model:latest
# ✅ SUCCESS: Image pulled successfully
# 📊 Size: ~976MB (ARM64 architecture)
# 📅 Last Updated: 2025-06-09 (previous build)
```

#### ❌ Container Startup Test:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 esengendo730/sf-business-model:latest
# ❌ FAILED: Container exited immediately (Exit code: 0)
# 🔍 Issue: Current image runs data pipeline instead of Streamlit app
# 📝 Logs: Missing required environment variables (FRED_API_KEY, CENSUS_DATA_API_KEY)
```

#### 📊 GitHub Actions Workflow Status:
- **Run #16**: ❌ FAILED (completed 2025-07-20T21:57:47Z)
- **Commit**: "🐛 Fix GitHub Actions deployment by updating main Dockerfile entry point"
- **Issue**: Workflow still failing despite Dockerfile CMD fix
- **Next Step**: Need to investigate workflow logs for specific error

### Test Results:
```bash
# Docker Pull Test
docker pull esengendo730/sanfrancisco_business_model:latest
# Result: "not found" - Image not deployed yet
```

## Workflow Progress:
- ✅ Code pushed to main branch successfully
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow triggered
- 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline processing (testing, building, deploying)
- ⏳ Waiting for Docker Hub authentication and deployment

## Next Steps:
1. Add GitHub Secrets for Docker Hub authentication
2. Monitor workflow completion at: https://github.com/esengendo/San-Francisco-Business-Model/actions
3. Verify Docker Hub deployment
4. Test pulling and running the deployed image

## Expected Timeline:
- **GitHub Actions**: 3-5 minutes for complete workflow
- **Docker Hub**: Images available immediately after successful push
- **Multi-platform**: Both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures supported
